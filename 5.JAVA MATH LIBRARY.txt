The Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Math.max(x,y)
The Math.max(x,y) method can be used to find the highest value of x and y:

Math.min(x,y)
The Math.min(x,y) method can be used to find the lowest value of x and y:

Math.sqrt(x)
The Math.sqrt(x) method returns the square root of x:

Math.abs(x)
The Math.abs(x) method returns the absolute (positive) value of x:

Random Numbers
Math.random() returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive):

To get more control over the random number, e.g. you only want a random number between 0 and 100, you can use the following formula:

Example
int randomNum = (int)(Math.random() * 101);  // 0 to 100
